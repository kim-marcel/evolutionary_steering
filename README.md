## Features

* Press 'd' to toggle Debug-Mode
* Press space-bar to generate a new ant at a random location with random genes
* Left-click: Add new food
* Right-click: Add new poison
* Predators eat poison and ants

## TODO

* Ants can't "see" predators yet: They should be able to see preadtors and flee from them
